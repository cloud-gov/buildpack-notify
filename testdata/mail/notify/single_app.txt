Hi cloud.gov user,

cloud.gov frequently updates the programming language buildpacks available to
our customers. Buildpack updates include programming language updates and 
often include security fixes.

We recently updated the buildpack in use by your application. You should 
restage or redeploy your application to take advantage of the update.

Keep in mind that restaging is the quickest way to
upgrade, but causes downtime so you may want to leverage your deployment infrastructure
if you have set up zero-downtime deploys.

You can restage your application by opening the command line and entering 
the following commands:

  cf target -o sandbox -s dev ; cf restage my-drupal-app


For more information on keeping your application updated and secure, see: 
https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/app-maintenance/

If you have questions, you can email us at cloud-gov-support@gsa.gov.

Thank you,
The cloud.gov team
