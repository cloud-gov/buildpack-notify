Hi cloud.gov user,

cloud.gov frequently updates the programming language buildpacks available to
our customers. Buildpack updates include programming language updates and
often include security fixes.

We recently updated buildpacks in use by your applications. You should
restage or redeploy your applications to take advantage of the update.

A rolling restage operation is the quickest way to upgrade without incurring
downtime. You may still want to leverage your deployment infrastructure to
perform the upgrade if you have compliance requirements for redeployment operations.

You can restage your applications by opening the command line and entering
the following commands:

  cf target -o sandbox -s dev ; cf restage --strategy rolling my-drupal-app

  cf target -o paid-org -s staging ; cf restage --strategy rolling my-wordpress-app


For more information about the buildpack update(s), please see the following release notes:

  python_buildpack v1.7.43: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/python-buildpack/releases/tags/v1.7.43

  ruby_buildpack v1.8.43: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/ruby-buildpack/releases/tags/v1.8.43


For more information on keeping your application updated and secure, see:

Thank you,
The cloud.gov team
